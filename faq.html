       <br></br>
       <li>How accurate is the TASoft LLC forecasting?
       <br></br>
         <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/ways-to-evaluate-regression-models-77a3ff45ba70" target="_blank">Standard error measurement</a> is used to assess our stock forecast accuracy. And furthermore 50 day forecast 
         can be as accurate as next day forecast. See <a href="services/shorttradingscenarios.html">examples</a>. In general, users can observe two types of accuracies:
  <br></br>
         <ul>
         <li>Actual trading day close price follows forecasted price.
         <li>Actual trading day close price trend follows forecasted price trend.
         </ul>
                  <br></br>
        <li>TASoft LLC forecasting covers entire US market. Why does it only offer limited stock forecasting?
        <br></br>
        Reasonable detailed computing over entire US market is very expensive in terms of computing. Instead, TASoft LLC stock forecasting is conducted through three stage processes.
        <ul>
        <li>Scanning Forecasting Process: Limited computing space
        is conducted over the entire US market.
        <li>Selection Process: Automatic process to assess/select interesting stocks for refining forecasting computing process.
        <li>Final Forecasting Process: The results of the later forecasting process offers the final forecasting products which is available to clients.
		</ul>
        <br></br>
        <li>General perception on stock forecasting accuracy is very negative! 
       Some AI stock forecast is able to forecast next day with some accuracy. Why does TASoft LLC
        forecast 50 days and beyond with great accuracy?
        <br></br>
        TASoft LLC stock forecasting is backed by newly discovered theory and mathematical solutions. 
        It doesn't use Deep Learning AI. Instead it has its own machine learning solution. See <a href="science/science.html">details</a>.
		<br></br>
      <li>Can you describe what products or services you sell?
      <br></br>
       TASoft LLC offers variety of products and services, including stock and 
       sector index fund forecasting. See <a

       managers who seeks high returns!
       <br></br>
       <li>Is TASoft LLC stock forecasting computing very expensive?
       <br></br>
       The short answer is no. With regular computing power laptop, it works well.
       <br></br>
        <li>Is TASoft LLC forecasting accuracy in the process of improvement?
       <br></br>
       There are occasionally trading days, even weeks of close perfect forecasting for even very volatile stock. It is elusive 
       to achieve forecasting consistency like that. Still the current mathematical solution is still in baseline, of course, 
       more engineering effort needed to achieve consistent accuracy. However, we are confident that it is possible to achieve perfect 
       solution and accuracy with engineering entire space and sufficient computing power!
