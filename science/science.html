      <h2>Science and Technology Foundations</h2>
      <p>Time-Series Forecasting has been hot research topic since the introduction of machine learning. 
      Dr. Frank Zhu has developed new foundational time-series forecasting theory and 
      mathematical solution. All these leads to the successful machine learning application. Instead of using
       function based machine learning which current machine learning theory are based on, we invented method
        based machine learning. Therefore, we can still forecast well without the assumption of existence
        of pattern from 
        the time-series historical data.</p>

        <h3>Practice and testing on Stock historical time-series data</h3>
        <p>Because of the availability of stock historical data, we did extensive testing and practice  
        with the traditional accuracy verification process. Historical time-series data are 
         divided into training data set and verification data set. We can therefore first train the model on 
         training data set and then apply the model on the verification data set to obtain its
          accuracy. In this way, we can build variety of data  models to search for the best performance model
          in terms of accuracy on verification data set</p>

        <h3>Stock future forecasting performance</h3>
        <ul>
	        <li>For most high volatile stocks on regular laptop computing power (in fact, lower volatile stocks are not included in the practice), we have achieved very
	        high accuracy on the verification data set.</li>
	        <li>On real time accuracy performance, if it achieved high accuracy on verification data set,
	        it also achieved high accuracy.</li>
	        <li>We have currently practice our forecasting within 50 days. However, if enough historical data available, it can forecast much
	        beyond that theoretically. </li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8" style="color:white">
        <h3>Theory on high accuracy stock forecasting</h3>
        <p>Our mathematical solution strongly suggests that forecasting accuracy is continuous and consistent.
         Therefore if it achieves high accuracy on verification data set, it can achieve high accuracy on real time data
          as well.</p>

        <div class="col-md-8"style="color:white">
        <h3>Entering a new era of understanding time?</h3>
        <p>Our initial baseline results on stock forecasting demonstrates the accuracy of time series forecasting.
        Furthermore when associating forecasting with historical patterns, it enables us to forecast future events which were deemed impossible unless pre-scheduled.
        Further or future studies in this new area might open a new door for understanding the meaning of time from 
        the perspective of historical time series data.</p>
